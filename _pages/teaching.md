#### Responsibilities:
During my time teaching Introduction to Python (DSC20), I held weekly office hours where I assisted students with understanding course material, answering their questions, and providing additional academic support. I was also responsible for creating assignments that were both engaging and challenging, aimed at reinforcing the concepts taught in class and assessing student understanding effectively.

In addition to creating assignments, I graded exams and assignments, providing detailed feedback to help students improve their understanding and performance. I also managed the team of teaching assistants, coordinating their efforts and ensuring consistency in grading and support provided to students. Another key responsibility was maintaining the course website, ensuring that all necessary resources, announcements, and updates were readily accessible to students, facilitating a smooth and organized learning experience.

I also taught discussion sections, which provided an opportunity to delve deeper into the course topics. These sessions were designed to encourage student participation, clarify complex concepts, and foster a collaborative learning environment.
