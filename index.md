## About Me

Hello! My name is **Benjamin Chen**. I am a Data Scientist specializing in Geospatial predictions, specifically wildfire modeling. I graduated Magna Cum Laude from the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) with a B.S. in Data Science and a minor in Human Centered Design. I'm broadly interested in Dark Pattern design, AI ethics, catastrophe modeling, and deep learning within a geospatial context.

I currently work at Delos Insurance, a startup MGA applying wildfire science to home insurance. As a key developer of our wildfire model, I leverage advanced tools such as Earth Engine and ArcGIS to enhance our predictive capabilities and risk assessments. My work involves integrating geospatial data and sophisticated modeling techniques to provide accurate and reliable predictions.

I've had diverse experiences in the tech industry, having held roles as a Research Assistant at Intel Corporation, a Data Engineer Intern at Harbor Capital Advisors, and a Software Engineer Intern at Qualcomm Institute. At Intel, I supported an investigation on user behavior related to dark pattern designs and processed telemetry data to generate insights. At Harbor Capital Advisors, I built a POC for automating Business Intelligence processes and integrated live data for dynamic reporting. At Qualcomm Institute, I developed prototype NFTs and a DAO using quantum voting and cryptocurrency principles. My work consistently involves leveraging tools to drive innovation and efficiency.

I was also a teaching assistant at UCSD, specifically under the Data Science department for Dr. [Marina Langlois](https://datascience.ucsd.edu/people/marina-langlois/). I supported the fundamentals of python course, aiding over 2,000 students in their academic journeys. I received the 2024 Outstanding TA Award for my contribution to the data science community at UCSD.
